# Streamlit-app
Background Description: Streamlit allows for the rapid creation of web applications to showcase data insights interactively. In this task, youâ€™ll create a Streamlit dashboard to visualize the key findings and insights from your data analysis and Generative AI report.

Task Instructions:
Build a Streamlit app to visualize key aspects of your dataset and insights from your analysis.
Include interactive elements like sliders, graphs, and filters to make the dashboard more dynamic.
Showcase the AI-generated insights and visualizations, allowing users to explore the data in an engaging way.
Deploy the Streamlit app on a platform like Heroku, Streamlit Cloud.

Insights:
The dataframe has been successfully loaded, and I have retrieved its structure, including the first few rows and the column names. This will help us understand the data better and identify key insights.
The dataset contains various columns related to student performance, parental involvement, and other factors. Key columns include:

Name: The name of the student.
Maths, Reading, Writing: Scores in respective subjects.
Parents Name, Parents Education: Information about the student's parents.
Sleep Time, Social Media, Food, Test Prep: Various factors that may influence student performance.
Overall Performance, Performance Category: Insights into the student's overall performance.
The analysis of the dataset has provided summary statistics and a correlation matrix for the Maths, Reading, and Writing scores. This information is crucial for understanding the overall performance of students and the relationships between different subjects.
The correlation matrix indicates strong relationships between the subjects, with Reading and Writing showing the highest correlation (approximately 0.95), followed by Maths and Reading (approximately 0.79) and Maths and Writing (approximately 0.79). This suggests that students who perform well in one subject tend to perform well in the others, highlighting the interconnectedness of these skills.
The analysis of overall performance categories and parental involvement insights has been completed. Here are the results:

Overall Performance Counts: This shows the distribution of student performance across different categories.
Parental Involvement Insights: This indicates the frequency of various insights related to parental involvement in education.
Here are the results:

Overall Performance Counts: {66.0: 9
Parental Involvement Insights: {'Learn More: Go to About the NHES': 64
These insights can help identify trends in student performance and the impact of parental involvement.
